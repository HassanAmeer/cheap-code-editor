# Cheap Hooks

Cheap supports Pi-native extension package hooks and user-owned Bash hooks.

## Native Pi Packages

Use Pi packages when a package ships native Pi hooks:

```bash
cheap install npm:<package-name>
cheap list
```

Pi package extensions subscribe to native Pi events such as `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `session_start`, `session_before_compact`, `session_compact`, and `session_shutdown`. Cheap includes a narrow Pi compatibility shim for packages that expect older field names, including `tool_result.output`, `tool_result.params`, and the legacy `before_provider_response` event name.

## Core Bash Hooks

Cheap core still supports local Bash command hooks for commands executed through the `bash` tool and interactive `!` / `!!` shell commands.

Global hooks:

```bash
~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash/*.sh
~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash/*.bash
```

Project hooks:

```bash
.cheap/hooks/bash/*.sh
.cheap/hooks/bash/*.bash
```

Global Bash hooks are enabled by default. Project Bash hooks are discovered but disabled by default.

Manage hook resources from:

```text
/resources
/hooks
```

or from the CLI:

```bash
cheap resources list
cheap resources disable hooks.bash
cheap resources enable hooks.bash.project.my-hook-sh
cheap resources disable hooks.bash.global.my-hook-sh
```

Each Bash hook runs as `bash <hook-path>`. Cheap passes the current command in environment variables:

```bash
CHEAP_HOOK_EVENT=tool_call
CHEAP_TOOL_NAME=bash
CHEAP_TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND='git status'
CRUSH_TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND='git status'
```

Cheap also writes JSON to stdin:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "bash",
  "input": {
    "command": "git status"
  },
  "cwd": "/path/to/project"
}
```

No output means "allow unchanged":

```bash
exit 0
```

Plain stdout rewrites the command:

```bash
echo "git status --short"
```

JSON stdout can rewrite the command:

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"decision":"allow","command":"git status --short"}'
```

Block by returning JSON:

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"decision":"block","reason":"Use pnpm, not npm"}'
```

or by exiting with status `2` and writing a reason:

```bash
echo "Use pnpm, not npm" >&2
exit 2
```

Any other failure is treated as allow unchanged. This keeps a broken local hook from breaking the agent session.

## Claude Code Adapter

Claude Code hook format is not part of the cheap core hook contract. Cheap can run existing Claude Code command hooks through a disabled-by-default compatibility extension.

Enable the adapter:

```bash
cheap resources enable extensions.claude-code-hook-adapter
```

Restart Cheap after enabling the adapter. Discovered Claude Code hook commands also appear under the Hooks tab in `/resources`, where they can be enabled or disabled individually.

If those hooks depend on Claude Code skills, enable the separate skill compatibility extension:

```bash
cheap resources enable extensions.claude-code-skills
```

That extension loads `~/.claude/skills` and the nearest project `.claude/skills` directory into Cheap's native available-skills prompt, contributes them through Pi resource discovery so `/skill:name` works, and provides a Claude-compatible `Skill` tool for hooks that ask the model to invoke `Skill("name")`.

The adapter reads hooks from the user config and the nearest ancestor project config:

```bash
~/.claude/settings.json       # user
.claude/settings.json         # project
.claude/settings.local.json   # local project
```

It honors top-level `disableAllHooks: true`.

Supported events:

- `PreToolUse`
- `PostToolUse`
- `PostToolUseFail` — runs only when a tool result is an error (`PostToolUse` still runs for all results)
- `PostToolBatch` — synthesized once per turn after all tool executions in that turn finish
- `SessionStart`
- `PreCompact`
- `PostCompact`
- `UserPromptSubmit`
- `Stop` — fires once when the agent finishes responding (pi `agent_end`); a `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` result continues the run, with `stop_hook_active` set on re-entry. Payload includes `stop_reason` and `error_message` from the final assistant message
- `StopFail` — fires in addition to `Stop` only when the run ends with `stop_reason` `error` or `aborted` (`Stop` still fires for all runs). Same payload and block/continuation semantics as `Stop`, plus `is_error: true`; use `stop_reason` to distinguish provider errors from user aborts
- `TaskCompleted` — fires at the end of each turn (pi `turn_end`); observer-only, block decisions are ignored. ⚠️ Note: this diverges from Claude Code, where `TaskCompleted` fires when a task-list item is marked completed (via the `TaskUpdate` tool) and can block; cheap has no task-list tool, so this name is bound to per-turn semantics instead
- `TurnStart`, `MessageStart`, `MessageEnd`, `ModelSelect`, `UserBash` — cheap-specific observer hooks for pi events with no Claude Code equivalent
- `SubagentStart` — fires when an `Agent` tool subagent spawns (cheap `subagents:started` bus event); observer-only. Payload adds `subagent_id`, `subagent_type`, `description`, `visibility`
- `SubagentStop` — fires when a subagent completes or fails (`subagents:completed` / `subagents:failed`); observer-only. Payload adds the `SubagentStart` fields plus `status`, `result`, `error`, `abort_reason`, `duration_ms`, `tool_uses`, `tokens`, and `is_error` (`true` on the failed path: status `error`, `stopped`, or `aborted`). Both hooks also fire for `visibility: "system"` agents, which are hidden from the subagent widget for UI reasons only — filter on the `visibility` field if you want user-visible agents only
- `SessionEnd`

Plugin packages installed via `cheap install` may ship a `hooks/hooks.json` (or `.claude-plugin/hooks/hooks.json`). Those hooks honor the same full event set as the adapter above; `SessionStart` context from packages is injected into the system prompt.

Example:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Rewrite `git status`

Create a global hook:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash
cat > ~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash/git-status-short.sh <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if [ "${CHEAP_TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND:-}" = "git status" ]; then
  echo "git status --short --branch"
fi
SH
```

Start Cheap and ask it to run `git status`. The displayed Bash command should show the rewritten command.

### Block `npm install`

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash
cat > ~/.config/cheap/harness/hooks/bash/pnpm-only.sh <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

case "${CHEAP_TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND:-}" in
  npm\ install*|npm\ i*)
    printf '%s\n' '{"decision":"block","reason":"Use pnpm install in this repository."}'
    ;;
esac
SH
```

### Read JSON From Stdin

Use stdin when you need the project cwd or want to avoid shell parsing.

```bash
mkdir -p .cheap/hooks/bash
cat > .cheap/hooks/bash/block-rm-root.sh <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

payload="$(cat)"
command="$(node -e 'const p=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]); console.log(p.input.command)' "$payload")"

if [ "$command" = "rm -rf /" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' '{"decision":"block","reason":"Refusing to remove root."}'
fi
SH
```

Then enable the project hook:

```bash
cheap resources enable hooks.bash.project.block-rm-root-sh
```

## RTK Hook

Cheap's built-in RTK integration is exposed as:

```text
hooks.rtk-rewrite
```

It runs before user Bash hooks. User hooks see the RTK-rewritten command when RTK changes it.

Disable it with:

```bash
cheap resources disable hooks.rtk-rewrite
```

## Notes

- Hooks run synchronously before command execution.
- Hook timeout is 5 seconds.
- Hook output is interpreted as a command rewrite unless it is recognized JSON.
- Use `/resources` to see discovered hook IDs.
- Restart is not required for hook enable/disable changes, but adding or removing hook files is easiest to verify by restarting Cheap.
